# ðŸŽ† Python Fireworks Simulation

This project is a **fireworks simulation** built with **Python** and **Pygame**.  
I was inspired by a video on TikTok where someone coded a similar project in **JavaScript**, and I decided to recreate it using Python.

## Features
- **Realistic Fireworks**: Particles decelerate and fade out after an explosion.
- **Flash Effect**: A subtle flash occurs when a firework explodes.
- **Sound Effects**: A `pop` sound plays for each firework explosion.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pygame library
- `pop.mp3` sound file (included in the project folder)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   `git clone https://github.com/calebborst/fireworks.git`
   `cd fireworks`

2. Install the required library:
   `pip install pygame`

3. Make sure `pop.mp3` is in the same directory as the script.

## Running the Project
To run the script:
`python fireworks_simulation.py`

Enjoy the fireworks show! ðŸŽ†
